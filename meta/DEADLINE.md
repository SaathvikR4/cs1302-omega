## Part 1: App Description

> My Application is meant to imitate a Prove you are not a Robot Captcha.
  The Captcha uses the DogApi and the CatApi for the images to be clicked on.
  There will be three rounds for the user to prove they are not a robot.


TODO WRITE / REPLACE

## Part 2: New

> I have never used mouse events and I thought they were very fun the use and implement.
  Also, playing around with the different effects that javaFx offers for the nodes within
  the scene graph was very fun.

TODO WRITE / REPLACE

## Part 3: Retrospect
